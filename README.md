# R2-Dreamer: Redundancy-Reduced World Models without Decoders or Augmentation

This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of [R2-Dreamer][r2dreamer] (ICLR 2026), a computationally efficient world model that achieves high performance on continuous control benchmarks. It also includes an efficient PyTorch DreamerV3 reproduction that trains **~5x faster** than a widely used [codebase][dreamerv3-torch], along with other baselines. Selecting R2-Dreamer via the config provides an additional **~1.6x speedup** over this baseline.

## Instructions

Install dependencies. This repository is tested with Ubuntu 24.04 and Python 3.11.

If you prefer Docker, follow [`docs/docker.md`](docs/docker.md).

```bash
# Installing via a virtual env like uv is recommended.
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run training on default settings:

```bash
python3 train.py logdir=./logdir/test
```

Monitoring results:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir ./logdir
```

Switching algorithms:

```bash
# Choose an algorithm via model.rep_loss:
# r2dreamer|dreamer|infonce|dreamerpro
python3 train.py model.rep_loss=r2dreamer
```

For easier code reading, inline tensor shape annotations are provided. See [`docs/tensor_shapes.md`](docs/tensor_shapes.md).


## Available Benchmarks
At the moment, the following benchmarks are available in this repository.

| Environment        | Observation | Action | Budget | Description |
|-------------------|---|---|---|-----------------------|
| [Meta-World](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Metaworld) | Image | Continuous | 1M | Robotic manipulation with complex contact interactions.|
| [DMC Proprio](https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control) | State | Continuous | 500K | DeepMind Control Suite with low-dimensional inputs. |
| [DMC Vision](https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control) | Image | Continuous |1M| DeepMind Control Suite with high-dimensional images inputs. |
| [DMC Subtle](envs/dmc_subtle.py) | Image | Continuous |1M| DeepMind Control Suite with tiny task-relevant objects. |
| [Atari 100k](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Arcade-Learning-Environment) | Image | Discrete |400K| 26 Atari games. |
| [Crafter](https://github.com/danijar/crafter) | Image | Discrete |1M| Survival environment to evaluates diverse agent abilities.|
| [Memory Maze](https://github.com/jurgisp/memory-maze) | Image |Discrete |100M| 3D mazes to evaluate RL agents' long-term memory.|

Use Hydra to select a benchmark and a specific task using `env` and `env.task`, respectively.

```bash
python3 train.py ... env=dmc_vision env.task=dmc_walker_walk
```

## Headless rendering

If you run MuJoCo-based environments (DMC / MetaWorld) on headless machines, you may need to set `MUJOCO_GL` for offscreen rendering. **Using EGL is recommended** as it accelerates rendering, leading to faster simulation throughput.

```bash
# For example, when using EGL (GPU)
export MUJOCO_GL=egl
# (optional) Choose which GPU EGL uses
export MUJOCO_EGL_DEVICE_ID=0
```

## Code formatting

If you want automatic formatting/basic checks before commits, you can enable `pre-commit`:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
# This sets up a pre-commit hook so that checks are run every time you commit
pre-commit install
# Manual pre-commit run on all files
pre-commit run --all-files
```
